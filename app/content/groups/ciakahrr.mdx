According to most sources, the Ciakahrr are an ancient 6th-density pure-blood reptilian race who are the rulers of
the Draco Empire in the constellation of Alpha Draconis. Most sources depict the Ciakahrr as ruthless and
bloodthirsty, so it is important to look at reality from their perspective before assigning any judgment.

The following information was retrieved from a source connected to the entity known as Moraegiam. Moraegiam is
presumably a Ciakahrr, although this is not explicitly stated.

The (Alpha) Draconians came from a different version of the universe — one which has since collapsed —
but they managed to use their technology to move their species, along with a few others, into our reality.
When they arrived, they were considered the most technologically advanced race in the galaxy. However,
in the place they came from, that was not the case. In this alternate reality, there was a race that surpassed
even the Draconians.
This advanced culture created AI in the form of large, metallic, spider-like beings —
the Nothing — that destroyed everything. In our reality, it has been their goal to avoid a similar disaster
by reducing the possibilities of such timelines.

Due to being ancient beings who have far exceeded their reincarnational capital, they require energy to prevent
themselves from ascending to a non-physical and consequently non-Draconian state. The Ciakahrr enjoy the separation
that defines physical existence, and to prolong it, they need to harvest energy in the form of emotion.

In particular, "feeding" on the fears of humanity has proven to be a very nutritious supplement for the Draconians.
This is why the Draconians allowed humans to remain on Earth — which they consider theirs — and why they helped
humanity create a reality where most would live in fear. That said, this has always been a choice for humans,
both individually and collectively, and it seems the collective is slowly moving away from fear and from being useful to the Draconians.
They claim they have been in service to humanity by pushing it onto a faster evolutionary track. Until now, the
Draconians have protected Earth — at least from anything that would have hurt their bottom line — but now, even
this is changing.
