The Yits are a benevolent and friendly race of human-reptilian hybrids from the 5th density.
They were created by the Nihal who are descendants of Earth humans from a possible future timeline.
The Nihal traveled to the past, which is also our current past and created the Yits by crossing their
genes with a reptile's. This new species grew and over time became the Yits who now can be found
in our present time.

During their development the Yits were attacked by alpha draconians and much of their race was wiped out.
The main cause of the attack was presumably that the Yits were a benevolent and positive race of reptiles
working with humans,
and their existence energetically opposed the negative dracos who consequently deemed them a threat to the
stability of the empire. The Yits would survive however the attacks on them ultimately led some reptilians
to begin disconnecting themselves from the empire.

The Yits are a part of the Galactic Federation (of Worlds). Their name comes from their planet Yit which
orbits the star NE (Capella) in the Auriga constellation.

The Yits have a small military defense force that they are in the process of eliminating as most of their
species consider it a hindrance in their current evolutionary stage.

The Yits are helping humans by giving messages, spiritual guidance and connecting humanity to other entities.
