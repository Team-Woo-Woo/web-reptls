Kalask like the Ciakahrr are a 6th density pure blood reptilian race from the Draco Empire.
They are not as infamous as the latter and they are more friendly at least by alpha draconian standards.
According to Kalask they were created by the Carians (the bird people) around
the same time as the royal reptilian lines (the Ciakahrr) whom are kind of an ancestor
species to Kalask.

The Carians created the dracos to be their mercenary force, however after some time they rebelled.
A great war has been fought at the end of which the dracos including Kalask became independent.
At some point the Draco Empire was created and Kalask has been a member since.

Kalask has been involved in many galactic wars in their long history. One such war was against a feline race
called Metax who refused to bend the knee to the empire and could not be subordinated using covert means the same
way Earth was taken over. The Empire selected Kalask to wage war and defeat Metax, however the felines put up
a fight and depleted both Kalask's and their own reserves. Eventually Kalask made peace with the tenacious Metax
to avoid the destruction of both of their races. The two recognizing the strength and worth of each other formed a bond
of friendship so while Kalask has lost the war they gained a friend.

Kalask like most dracos focus their society on their military and the needs of that military.
In essence they are very much like the Spartans of ancient greece although much, much, much more
developed technologically, spiritually and have reached a point where they don't need to wage wars anymore,
much like the philosopher kings from Plato's Republic.

At some point in the distant past the Draco Empire tried to elinimate the benevolent hybrid reptilian race we known as the Yits.
It has been claimed that this aggression against a fellow reptilian race was the trigger for the revolution of Kalask.
Alpha draconians are very adept at using their lower chakras, however some of the higher chakras such as their hart chakras
are closed due the negative way love and compassion can affect a society based on military power. Kalask decided to open
their heart chakra and let the emotions come trough and at the same time moved from a negative polarity to a neutral
one. In order be able to handle their emotions they observe and connect to Earth humans who are known to have the highest
extremes of emotions in the galaxy. Kalask are still part of the empire although their position might be somewhat precarious
due to their heretical belies.

Kalask do not take energy from humanity, however they have been involved with giving assistance to different Earth groups and have bases
in the solar system, but unlike the Ciakahrr they are working towards a symbiotic relationship with humanity.
