The Saurians are an Earth-based reptilian species seeded by the Alpha Draconians using their own genes, created
before the arrival of Earth humans.
The name Saurian is not an official designation, as they don’t seem to have or willing to share one.

Saurians are connected to humans energetically and spiritually, since both species share the same planet and
sometimes have incarnations from each other’s soul groups. They live mostly underground in caverns, or in higher
dimensions and densities, which makes them practically invisible to the average person—despite occupying the
same space and time.

When humans became sentient, the Saurians connected with them and shared their knowledge with the fledgling
species. However, this led to conflicts with star races and that ended up devastating the Saurian population.
The humans decided to cut ties with the Saurians, while the Draco Empire chose to lock down the planet and expel
any aliens they didn’t approve of. This action led to the great quarantine of humanity.

Saurians, like humans, are a mix of polarities. Some are friendly toward humans, some are not, and most simply
don’t care about them at all. When the quarantine began, human leadership obtained Draco technology to subdue
and control the human population. While this technology is reptilian in origin, it has been used by humans—not
by Earth reptilians. That said, some of the Saurian leaders have admitted to being in contact with human
leadership and making deals with them.

Generally speaking, Saurians believe that any harm humans have inflicted upon themselves should not be blamed
on them. Most Saurians care so little about humanity that they wouldn't even consider harming a human.
However, they are concerned about humans contacting and dealing with extraterrestrials who have attacked them in the past.
This concern stems from a grudge more than from a fear of those aliens.

Saurians have moved from the 4th density to the 5th, so even if humanity shifts to the 4th density, they still
won’t be able to physically perceive the Saurians. However, as humans become more telepathic, they can still
annoy Earth reptilians—either through their psychic abilities or with help from their alien associates.

Earth reptilians, like most reptilian species, are naturally gifted in psychic abilities and are extremely
skilled in telepathy. They do not share the human emotional spectrum, but by connecting with humans
telepathically, they can access the emotional experiences a normal human is capable of. This connection is
dangerous for the Saurian, because the experience is so unique that the entity can easily become addicted to it.
This is one of the reasons why Saurians prefer to keep their distance.
